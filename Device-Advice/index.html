Although\nI won’t be able to have a direct impact on the leadership of the club, I’ll still be\nvolunteering regularly throughout the year.\n\nPresident: Deb Destahun\nOrganization Ambassador: Jade Peterson\nInternal Logistics: Matt Campbell\nSecretary and Finance: Josh Magri\nExternal Relations + Campus Outreach: Evan Jacobs and Evita Woolsey\nMarketing + Social Media: ?\n\n\nAs you may notice, we’re still looking for a student to join us in marketing\nthe organization for next semester! This is a great opportunity, as now that\nwe’ve finished rebranding, there’s a ton of potential for creating new materials\nand exploring paths for advertising. Please reach out at\nstudorg-DeviceAdvice@uiowa.edu, if you’re interested we’d love to hear from you!\n\nThe future of Device Advice\nGrowing our executive board so that we have bandwidth to expand to other universities.\nUsing our new marketing tools to ensure that volunteers always have seniors to help at sessions.\nWorking with the existing technology support department at Oaknoll to provide more direct and regular help.\n\nWhat I learnedIn learning about my own leadership tendencies while holding\nthe president position, I noticed a nasty habit of taking on more than I needed\ntoo, even though I had a team of fully willing and capable students around me.\nThat and finding creative ways to help keep very busy people actively involved\nin a common mission has been valuable in all areas of life so I’m\ngrateful for the experience.\nHow to get involved with us!\nIf you’re a student who wants to attend a session, or a company interested in\nsupporting the organization, please contact us! \nEmail: (studorg-DeviceAdvice@uiowa.edu)\n\n","dateCreated":"2019-06-06T00:00:00-06:00","dateModified":"2022-09-04T20:13:51-06:00","datePublished":"2019-06-06T00:00:00-06:00","description":"A quick recap of everything the executive team accomplished for the 2018-2019\nyear of Computer Comfort, including its complete rebranding into Device Advice.\n","headline":"Computer Comfort 2018-19","image":["https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,r_50:5/v1560018195/CComfort/DeviceAdviceBanner.webp"],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://mitchinson.dev/Device-Advice/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ben Mitchinson","sameAs":["https://github.com/bmitchinson","https://dev.to/bmitchinson","https://twitter.com/115bwm/","https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-mitchinson","/resume"],"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,w_110/v1532150487/BenMitchinson.com/profile.webp","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,w_110/v1532150487/BenMitchinson.com/profile.webp"}},"url":"https://mitchinson.dev/Device-Advice/","keywords":"Computer Comfort, Device Advice, Volunteering","thumbnailUrl":"https://res.cloudinary.com/dheqbiqti/image/upload/fl_progressive,r_50:5/v1560018195/CComfort/DeviceAdviceBanner.webp"}</script>

            <p>A quick recap of everything the executive team accomplished for the 2018-2019
year of Computer Comfort, including its complete rebranding into <strong>Device Advice</strong>.
</br></p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>( If you’re wondering what Computer Comfort is, check out <a href="/Computer-Comfort-Year-3/">this post from last year</a> )</p>
<h3 id="What-got-done-this-year"><a href="#What-got-done-this-year" class="headerlink" title="What got done this year"></a>What got done this year</h3><ul>
<li>Renamed our club to “Device Advice”, updated our mission, and received new branding
materials to advertise starting new university chapters!</li>
<li>Spent 102 hours helping seniors during the fall semester, and 124 during the spring, for <strong>a combined 226 hours of volunteering!</strong><ul>
<li>(That’s over 12,240 renditions of singing the Hawkeye fight song, or sitting through 243 lectures of coursework)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provided free transportation for all sessions to make volunteering more accessible.</li>
<li>Doubled the number of sessions hosted at the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.icgov.org/city-government/departments-and-divisions/senior-center">Senior Center</a></li>
<li>Began a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://mailchi.mp/fe951d5ccaeb/computer-comfort-dec-update-147703">monthly email newsletter</a>
to help keep volunteers, partners, and seniors up to date on our progress.</li>
<li>Added two new student executive members.</li>
<li>Began a partnership with the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/socialwork/undergraduate-program/aging-longevity-studies-program">Aging and Longevity Studies Program</a>
to reach new undergraduate members and areas of the community.</li>
<li>Presented at both the Fall and Spring org fairs for the first time.</li>
<li>Grew our active member count from forty trained volunteers, to over one hundred.</li>
<li>Separated from being registered as a Tippie College of Business organization, in favor of a campus-wide org status.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Updated-Mission-Statement"><a href="#Updated-Mission-Statement" class="headerlink" title="Updated Mission Statement"></a>Updated Mission Statement</h3><p>While rebranding we decided to revisit our mission statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Device Advice strives to shrink the digital divide between generations by
educating older adults on today’s technology while creating meaningful
connections in the process.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We wanted it to reflect the half and half balance of 1.) creating meaningful
relationships and 2.) assisting with technology to keep older adults connected with
their families.</p>
<p>In addition to including our updated name, we’re now doing our best to use the term
“older adults”, as we’ve learned most prefer it over “seniors”.</p>
<h3 id="New-Executive-Board-For-2019-20"><a href="#New-Executive-Board-For-2019-20" class="headerlink" title="New Executive Board For 2019-20"></a>New Executive Board For 2019-20</h3><p>I’ll be leaving the executive board after three years to work on
personal <a href="/Current-Projects">projects like these</a> and begin my job search. Although
I won’t be able to have a direct impact on the leadership of the club, I’ll still be
volunteering regularly throughout the year.</br></br></p>
<ul>
<li>President: Deb Destahun</li>
<li>Organization Ambassador: Jade Peterson</li>
<li>Internal Logistics: Matt Campbell</li>
<li>Secretary and Finance: Josh Magri</li>
<li>External Relations + Campus Outreach: Evan Jacobs and Evita Woolsey</li>
<li>Marketing + Social Media: ?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As you may notice, we’re still looking for a student to join us in marketing
the organization for next semester! This is a great opportunity, as now that
we’ve finished rebranding, there’s a ton of potential for creating new materials
and exploring paths for advertising. </br></br>Please reach out at
studorg-DeviceAdvice@uiowa.edu, if you’re interested we’d love to hear from you!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="The-future-of-Device-Advice"><a href="#The-future-of-Device-Advice" class="headerlink" title="The future of Device Advice"></a>The future of Device Advice</h3><ul>
<li>Growing our executive board so that we have bandwidth to expand to other universities.</li>
<li>Using our new marketing tools to ensure that volunteers always have seniors to help at sessions.</li>
<li>Working with the existing technology support department at Oaknoll to provide more direct and regular help.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-I-learned"><a href="#What-I-learned" class="headerlink" title="What I learned"></a>What I learned</h3><p>In learning about my own leadership tendencies while holding
the president position, I noticed a nasty habit of taking on more than I needed
too, even though I had a team of fully willing and capable students around me.
That and finding creative ways to help keep very busy people actively involved
in a common mission has been valuable in all areas of life so I’m
grateful for the experience.</p>

                        <div class="media-content hide-xs font-merryweather"><p>This year for Mother’s Day, I decided to take an old digital photo frame we had lying around the house, and throw in some improvements. Originally, the frame had a small amount of internal memory, and could store low-resolution images loaded in from a flash drive. The process of moving files over was tedious, and I wanted anyone in my family to be able to easily contribute to the rotation of photos. Going away from school, I thought it would be neat to be able to easily update the frame with new photos, no matter where my siblings were in the world.

You may have seen these formations on plates such as the one shown above.
We set out to recreate the resonant frequency effects visually using lasers, as
a way for listeners and artists to see a real-time visualization of harmony and
dissonance. We were inspired by Nathan J. Wall, who demoed a similar idea
for an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://youtu.be/RxzMzSZF_b4?t=99">acoustics project</a> at USF Music Tech in 2012.

I've been with the org for two years now, and immediately after my first semester of volunteering, I applied for a position on the board. I knew right away that the club was something I wanted to participate in throughout my four years at Iowa, and I've held leadership roles within the club ever since. In that time we've grown a ton, so I wanted to share a bit about what we've done for the community, and how we've grown as a student org on campus.

<h3>Our Mission Statement:</h3>
> "Computer Comfort strives to bridge the age gap in Iowa City by educating seniors on today’s technology while building strong relationships in the process."

Our goal was to help kids increase their literary ability, learn relevant topics through current news, and then encourage dialog over those concepts with parents through provided parental controls and data-driven tooling with insight reports.
