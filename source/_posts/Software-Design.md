This semester I completed our project based Java course "Software Design" and learned
a <u>ton</u>. Over the course of the semester, we were given a grid of assignments
for completion, and I thought I'd post some of the highlights. I completed 13 short
programs that covered topics like GUI using Swing, Multithreading, Networking, and 
entry level database work.

# SneakerHead

Our final project was to create a marketplace client where buyers and sellers
could create accounts and post items. It was completed over the course of 72
hours in a hackathon style weekend, and we ended up being selected as one of the
top four groups, and demoed our solution to peers.</br></br>

I had used SQLite previously for a hackathon project, but building a true cross-relational
database was a great experience. We didn't have much time to implement features
around that part of our table structure, but I feel confident working with databases
headed into future projects.

# Blackjack

The rest of the assignments I completed on my own in preperation of our interview
exams. Blackjack took me the longest, but was a great way to learn threading
and networking for the first time. Although it turned out to work pretty solidly, 
it really opened my eyes to all I still need to learn for managing proper 
cross network client connections. Also learned how to do basic threading and 
conditional locks.</br></br>
