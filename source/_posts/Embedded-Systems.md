Overview of the Assembly and C assignments completed for ECE:3360 during my 
Junior year.
</br>
<!-- excerpt -->
For Embedded Systems this Spring, [Alex](https://github.com/abpwrs/) and I completed 5 labs and a final project, written in both C and Assembly.

For completing the labs, we programmed an ATiny45 and an ATMega48 in Atmel studio. We used digital I/O, timers, interrupts, handled complex timing issues, rotary pulse generators, and PWM generators all using assembly language.

### Final Project • [Poster](https://github.com/abpwrs/ece-3360-sp19/blob/master/final/FinalPoster.pdf) • [Github](https://github.com/abpwrs/ece-3360-sp19/blob/master/final/FinalProjectDir/FinalProjectDir/main.c)

For our final project, we used what we learned about serial interface protocols to create a program for morse code communication. Characters were interpreted with a sampling timer and sent to another device running the exact same program.</br></br>

Creating a single program to be run on both devices was a good challenge, Alex and I were pleased with the results, and we finished with an A in the course.
