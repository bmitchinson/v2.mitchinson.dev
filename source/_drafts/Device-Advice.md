</br>
<!-- more -->
### What got done this year
* Spent 102 hours helping seniors during the fall semester, and 124 during the spring, for **a combined 226 hours of volunteering!**
  * (That's over 12,240 renditions of singing the hawkeye fight song, or sitting through 243 lectures)
* Provided free transportation for all sessions to make volunteering more accessible.
* Doubled the amount of sessions hosted at the [Senior Center](https://www.icgov.org/city-government/departments-and-divisions/senior-center)
* Began a [monthly email newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/fe951d5ccaeb/computer-comfort-dec-update-147703) 
to help keep volunteers, partners, and seniors up to date on our progress.
* Added two new student executive members.
* Began a partnership with the [Aging and Longevity Studies Program](https://clas.uiowa.edu/socialwork/undergraduate-program/aging-longevity-studies-program)
to reach new undergraduate members and areas of the community.
* Presented at both the Fall and Spring org fairs for the first time.
* Grew our active member count from forty trained volunteers, to over one hundred.
* Separated from being registered as a Tippie College of Business organization, in favor of a campus wide org status.

### Rebranding

* process + marketing students -> PDF / Presentation Materials?

### Updated Mission Statement

While rebranding we decided to revisit our mission statement:

> "Device Advice strives to shrink the digital divide between generations by 
educating older adults on today's technology while creating meaningful 
connections in the process."

### New Executive Board For 2019-20

I'll be leaving the executive board after three years to work on
personal [projects like these](/Current-Projects) and begin my job search. Although
I won't be able to have a direct impact on the leadership of the club, I'll still be 
volunteering regularly throughout the year.</br></br>

* President: Deb Destahun
* Organization Ambassador: Jade Peterson
* Internal Logistics: Matt Campbell
* Secretary and Finance: Josh Magri
* External Relations + Campus Outreach: Evan Jacobs and Evita Woolsey
* Marketing + Social Media: ?

> As you may notice, we're still looking for a student to join us in marketing 
the organization for next semester! This is a great opportunity, as now that 
we've finished rebranding, there's a ton of potential for creating new materials
and exploring paths for advertising. </br></br>Please reach out at 
studorg-DeviceAdvice@uiowa.edu, if you're interested we'd love to hear from you!

### The future of ~~Computer Comfort~~ Device Advice 

* Growing our executive board so that we have bandwith to expand to other university!
* Using our new marketing tools to ensure that volunteers always have seniors to help at sessions
* Working with the existing technology support department at Oaknoll to provide more regular and direct help

### What I learned
I learned a ton about my own leadership tendencies while holding
the presidential position, as well as ways to help keep a team actively involved
in a common mission. I grew a habit of taking on more tasks then I needed too,
when I had a team of fully willing and capable students around me, so to be able
to give others ownership is something that's been helpful in all areas of life
when working on a team.
